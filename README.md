This was created for the game "Acceptance" by Wings-poo. Acceptance is a game to be submitted for Single Choice game jam 2024 (https://itch.io/jam/single-choice-jam-24).

This is made for creating object assets to be used in the game, thus it is not as interactive as a normal phone/chat app design. It only has the features:
- entering message in the chat box (format: [Name];[Message])
- displaying the messages in the phone

The format for entering the message in the chat box could be improved (i.e. removing the Name and putting it elsewhere). But it was kept as is due to the script being written beforehand, so this format is easier for me to put in the messages in the chat box.

This is missing "Ricky"'s profile picture. It may or may not be added later on.

Sample output (except the chat box doesn't follow the format since this is used for the game's main menu image):

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
